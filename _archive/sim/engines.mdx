kombify Sim supports multiple simulation engines, each with different capabilities and trade-offs.

## Engine comparison

| Engine | Isolation | Speed | GPU | Network | Best for |
|--------|-----------|-------|-----|---------|----------|
| **Docker** | Container | Fast | No | Bridge | Quick testing, CI/CD |
| **Incus** | Container/VM | Fast | Yes | Full | Production-like testing |
| **QEMU** | Full VM | Slow | Yes | Full | Hardware emulation |
| **Azure** | Cloud VM | Medium | Yes | VNet | Cloud-based simulations |
| **External** | Varies | Varies | Varies | Full | Custom backends |

## Docker engine (default)

The default engine. Creates lightweight containers that behave like servers.

**Advantages:**
- Fastest startup (seconds)
- Lowest resource usage
- Works on any Docker host
- Best for rapid iteration

**Limitations:**
- Shared kernel (not full isolation)
- No GPU passthrough
- Limited network simulation

**Configuration:**
```yaml
engine: docker
```

## Incus engine

Uses Incus (successor to LXD) for container and VM-based simulations.

**Advantages:**
- Near-native performance
- GPU passthrough support
- Full network stack per node
- Can run real VMs alongside containers

**Limitations:**
- Requires Incus installed on host
- Linux only

**Configuration:**
```yaml
engine: incus
```

## QEMU engine

Full virtual machine emulation for maximum fidelity.

**Advantages:**
- Complete hardware emulation
- Full OS isolation
- Closest to production hardware
- GPU passthrough via VFIO

**Limitations:**
- Slowest startup (minutes)
- Highest resource usage
- Requires KVM support

**Configuration:**
```yaml
engine: qemu
```

## Choosing an engine

<Steps>
  <Step title="For quick testing">
    Use **Docker**. It's the fastest and works everywhere.
  </Step>
  <Step title="For production validation">
    Use **Incus** or **QEMU**. They provide closer-to-production fidelity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="For GPU workloads">
    Use **Incus** (container mode with GPU passthrough) or **QEMU** (VFIO).
  </Step>
  <Step title="For CI/CD pipelines">
    Use **Docker**. Lowest overhead, fastest feedback loop.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You can switch engines without changing your simulation spec. The engine is a runtime choice, not a configuration one.
