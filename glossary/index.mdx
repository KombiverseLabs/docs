</Note>

## A

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent">
    A lightweight daemon that runs on each managed node. Agents communicate with kombify Stack over gRPC using mTLS encryption, reporting node status and executing deployment commands.
    
    **Related:** [Node Agents](/stack/agents), [mTLS](#m)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Add-on">
    Optional services that extend a StackKit's functionality. Add-ons are pre-configured components (like monitoring, backup, or SSO) that integrate seamlessly with the base stack.
    
    **Example:** Adding Grafana monitoring to the base-homelab StackKit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Apply">
    The action of executing a validated deployment plan against real infrastructure. This happens after the plan has been reviewed and approved.
    
    **Related:** [Plan](#p), [Deployment Flow](/concepts/spec-driven)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
