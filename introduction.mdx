  Deploy your first homelab stack with our quick start guide
</Card>

## What is kombify?

**kombify** is the first platform that guides you through the entire lifecycle of modern self-hosted infrastructure. We transform fragmented, organically-grown homelab setups into professional, documented, and maintainable systems.

<Note>
  **Our promise:** The path from "I want a private cloud" to a secure, running system takes weeks today. kombify shortens this to hours.
</Note>

### The kombify flow

Every deployment follows a clear, intent-driven process:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Intent["🎯 Intent"] --> Spec["📋 Spec"]
    Spec --> Sim["🧪 Simulation"]
    Sim --> Deploy["🚀 Rollout"]
    Deploy --> Ops["⚙️ Operation"]
    
    style Intent fill:#1e293b,stroke:#4ade80,color:#f8fafc
    style Spec fill:#1e293b,stroke:#4ade80,color:#f8fafc
    style Sim fill:#1e293b,stroke:#4ade80,color:#f8fafc
    style Deploy fill:#1e293b,stroke:#4ade80,color:#f8fafc
    style Ops fill:#1e293b,stroke:#4ade80,color:#f8fafc
```

1. **Intent capture** — You describe your goal (e.g., "Secure photo cloud for my family")
2. **Spec generation** — A wizard creates a versioned `kombination.yaml` specification file
3. **Simulation** — kombify Sim tests your configuration before touching real hardware
4. **Rollout** — Validated blueprints (StackKits) are deployed to your infrastructure
5. **Operation** — Continuous drift detection keeps your system aligned with its desired state

```yaml kombination.yaml
# Your entire homelab in one file
stackkit: base-homelab
nodes:
  - name: main-server
    type: local
    connection:
      host: 192.168.1.100
services:
  - traefik    # Reverse proxy with auto-SSL
  - authelia   # Single sign-on
  - immich     # Photo management
  - homepage   # Dashboard
```

<Tip>
  kombify validates your configuration, resolves dependencies automatically, and deploys using battle-tested Infrastructure as Code patterns.
</Tip>

## The "Glass Box" approach

kombify follows the **Glass Box** principle: maximum guidance for beginners, full transparency and root access for experts.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe your intent" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate your spec" icon="file-code">
    The wizard creates a versioned `kombination.yaml` — your entire infrastructure in one file
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulate safely" icon="flask">
    Test your configuration in Docker containers that behave like real servers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy with confidence" icon="rocket">
    Apply to your infrastructure with OpenTofu and gRPC agents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Operate continuously" icon="arrows-rotate">
    kombify monitors for drift between your desired state and reality, proposing fixes automatically

## Golden states

These are the core beliefs that guide every kombify decision:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Everyone deserves agency over their digital infrastructure" icon="user">
    It must not matter whether someone is a techie or not — we design paths for both. kombify exists to make self-hosted infrastructure **understandable, operable, and evolvable**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Curation and professionalism are compatible with freedom" icon="scale-balanced">
    Our defaults are professional, opinionated, and safety-first. But we do **not** put hard walls around our curated standard. We expose escape hatches and extension points.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Intelligence in the product reconciles apparent opposites" icon="brain">
    We use intelligence (rules, models, agents) to make trade-offs transparent instead of hiding them. We look for **third ways** where others see "either/or".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Spec-first, agentic, and self-healing by design" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Desired state is always explicit, versioned, and explainable. The system detects drift, proposes fixes, and converges back without manual heroics.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Respect for existing reality" icon="handshake">
    Discovery, simulation, and planning come **before** changes. Existing setups are read, understood, and translated into the Spec — not blindly overwritten.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
