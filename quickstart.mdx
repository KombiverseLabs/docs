# Quick start with kombify Sphere

Get your first homelab running in under 5 minutes using the managed kombify Sphere platform. No installation required — just sign up, answer a few questions, and deploy.

<Note>
  **What you'll build:** A private photo cloud with reverse proxy, monitoring, and photo management — all configured automatically based on your answers.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="A server" icon="server">
    Any Linux server with 4GB+ RAM (VPS, old PC, Raspberry Pi 4+, Mini PC)
  </Card>
  <Card title="SSH access" icon="terminal">
    SSH access to your server with sudo privileges
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 1: Create an account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to [app.kombify.io](https://app.kombify.io) and create a free account using your email or GitHub.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify email">
    Check your email and click the verification link.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up passkey (recommended)">
    For passwordless login, register a passkey using your device's biometrics or a hardware key.
    
    <Tip>
      Passkeys are more secure than passwords and faster to use. kombify recommends registering at least two passkeys for recovery.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Launch kombify Stack

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open tool launcher">
    From the dashboard, click **"Launch Stack"** in the tool launcher.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose deployment mode">
    Select **"Managed"** to use Sphere's hosted Stack instance.
    
    <Note>
      **Managed:** Stack runs in the cloud, your data stays on your server.
      **Self-hosted:** You run Stack yourself — see [self-hosted quickstart](/quickstart-selfhosted).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Stack">
    You'll be automatically logged in via SSO — no separate credentials needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Create your first stack

This is where the magic happens. The wizard translates your goals into a complete infrastructure configuration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the Easy Wizard">
    Click **"New Homelab"** and select **"Easy Wizard"**.
    
    <Tip>
      **Easy Wizard** asks simple questions about what you want to build.
      **Technical Wizard** is for experts who want granular control over every setting.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Answer the wizard questions">
    The wizard will guide you through a few simple questions:
    
    | Question | Example Answer | What it affects |
    |----------|----------------|-----------------|
    | What do you want to build? | "Photo Cloud" | Services installed |
    | How many users? | "4 (Family)" | Resource allocation |
    | Where should it run? | "Local Server" | Connection method |
    | Do you have a domain? | "photos.mydomain.com" | SSL and DNS setup |
    | Backup level? | "Daily" | Backup configuration |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the generated spec">
    The wizard generates a complete `kombination.yaml` file:
    
    ```yaml
    stackkit: base-homelab
    version: "1.0.0"
    
    meta:
      name: "My Photo Cloud"
      description: "Private photo cloud for family"
    
    nodes:
      - name: main-server
        type: local
        connection:
          host: 192.168.1.100
          user: kombify
    
    services:
      - traefik      # Reverse proxy with auto-SSL
      - uptime-kuma  # Service monitoring
      - immich       # Photo management with AI
    
    backup:
      enabled: true
      schedule: "0 3 * * *"  # Daily at 3 AM
    ```
    
    <Note>
      This file is your **single source of truth**. It's version-controlled, shareable, and fully reproducible. You can edit it manually or use the wizard to make changes.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Simulate first (recommended)

Before deploying to real hardware, test your configuration in a safe virtual environment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start simulation">
    Click **"Simulate"** to launch kombify Sim. This creates Docker containers that behave like real servers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for startup">
    The simulation typically takes 30-60 seconds to start. You'll see:
    ```
    ✅ Creating virtual network...
    ✅ Starting simulation node: main-server
    ✅ Installing services...
       ├─ traefik: ready
       ├─ uptime-kuma: ready
       └─ immich: ready
    ✅ Simulation ready!
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your services">
    Access the simulated services to verify everything works:
    
    | Service | URL | What to check |
    |---------|-----|---------------|
    | **Traefik** | `http://localhost:8080` | Dashboard loads, routing configured |
    | **Uptime Kuma** | `http://localhost:3001` | Monitoring UI accessible |
    | **Immich** | `http://localhost:2283` | Photo upload works |
  </Step>

  <Step title="SSH into simulation (optional)">
    For debugging, you can SSH into the simulated server:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
    # Password: kombisim
    ```
    
    This gives you a real shell to inspect logs, check configurations, and troubleshoot.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stop simulation">
    When satisfied that everything works, click **"Stop Simulation"** to clean up.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Simulation is optional but **strongly recommended** for your first deployment. It catches configuration errors before they affect real infrastructure.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Deploy to real hardware

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install agent">
    Copy the agent installation command from the dashboard:
    
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.kombify.io/agent | sudo sh -s -- \
      --token YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN \
      --server https://api.kombisphere.io
    ```
    
    Run this on your server.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for connection">
    The dashboard will show **"Agent Connected"** when ready.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click **"Apply"** to start the deployment.
    
    You'll see real-time progress:
    ```
    ✅ Validating configuration...
    ✅ Connecting to node: main-server
    ✅ Installing Docker services...
       ├─ traefik: running
       ├─ uptime-kuma: running
       └─ immich: running
    ✅ Deployment complete!
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Access your services

Your services are now running! Access them at:

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **Traefik Dashboard** | `http://your-server:8080` | Reverse proxy status |
| **Uptime Kuma** | `http://your-server:3001` | Service monitoring |
| **Immich** | `http://your-server:2283` | Photo management |

<Note>
  If you configured a domain, services will be available at `service.yourdomain.com` with automatic SSL.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent not connecting">
    Check the agent status on your server:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status kombify-agent
    sudo journalctl -u kombify-agent -f
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Container not starting">
    Check Docker logs:
    
    ```bash
    docker logs traefik
    docker logs immich
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't access services">
    - Check firewall rules: `sudo ufw status`
    - Verify ports are open: `sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -E "80|443|2283"`
    - Check Docker network: `docker network ls`
