StackKits are pre-built infrastructure blueprints that define what services to run, how to configure them, and how they work together.

| Want AI/ML services? | No | Yes | Optional |
| Experience level? | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
| Typical use case | Photos, files, media | Dev env, AI, advanced apps | Production services |

## Add-ons

Every StackKit can be extended with **add-ons** — modular service packages you can mix and match:

- **Media** — Plex, Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr
- **Monitoring** — Prometheus, Grafana, Uptime Kuma
- **Backup** — Restic, Borgmatic, automated snapshots
- **AI** — Ollama, Open WebUI, Stable Diffusion
- **Security** — CrowdSec, Fail2ban, Vaultwarden

<Tip>
  Start with a base kit and add what you need. You can always add more add-ons later without rebuilding your stack.
