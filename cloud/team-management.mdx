## Best practices

<Accordion title="Principle of least privilege">
Assign the minimum role needed:
- **Viewer** for stakeholders who just need visibility
- **Operator** for team members who deploy and manage
- **Admin** for those who manage team and settings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Regular access reviews">
Periodically review team access:
- Remove inactive members
- Verify role assignments are still appropriate
- Check homelab assignments
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use specific homelab assignments">
For larger teams, assign specific homelabs rather than "All":
- Reduces blast radius of mistakes
- Clearer accountability
- Easier to audit
</Accordion>
