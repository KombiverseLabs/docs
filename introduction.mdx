# Welcome to KombiSphere

KombiSphere is a **hybrid infrastructure platform** that unifies cloud and home infrastructure into a single logical universe. Define your entire infrastructure in one spec file, simulate it before deployment, and manage everything through a unified control plane.

## What is KombiSphere?

KombiSphere combines three powerful open-source tools with a SaaS management layer:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="KombiStack - Hybrid control plane" icon="layer-group">
    The core orchestration engine that manages your infrastructure. Define your desired state in `kombination.yaml`, and KombiStack handles validation, provisioning, and deployment using OpenTofu.
    
    **Key features:**
    - Spec-driven architecture
    - CUE validation engine
    - Multi-node management via gRPC agents
    - Embedded PocketBase for state management
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="KombiSim - Simulation engine" icon="flask">
    Test your infrastructure configurations before deploying to real hardware. KombiSim creates lightweight Docker-based "VMs" that simulate your entire homelab environment.
    
    **Key features:**
    - Docker-based simulation nodes
    - Real SSH access to simulated servers
    - Pre-built templates for common setups
    - Full REST API for automation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="StackKits - IaC blueprints" icon="boxes-stacked">
    Declarative infrastructure blueprints with CUE validation and OpenTofu execution. StackKits provide battle-tested configurations for common homelab scenarios.
    
    **Key features:**
    - CUE schema validation
    - Multi-OS support (Ubuntu, Debian)
    - Simple and advanced deployment modes
    - Extensible variant system
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment options

Choose the deployment model that fits your needs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Self-hosted (Open core)">
    Use KombiStack, KombiSim, and StackKits directly without any SaaS components.
    
    ```bash
    # Clone and run
    git clone https://github.com/KombiverseLabs/KombiStack
    cd KombiStack
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    
    **Best for:**
    - Privacy-conscious users
    - Full control over data
    - No subscription costs
    - Custom modifications
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Managed SaaS">
    Use the fully managed KombiSphere platform with enterprise features.
    
    ```bash
    # Sign up at kombisphere.io
    # Launch tools from the dashboard
    # No infrastructure to manage
    ```
    
    **Best for:**
    - Teams and organizations
    - Enterprise SSO requirements
    - Managed updates and support
    - Multi-tenant collaboration
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Hybrid">
    Self-host the core tools, use SaaS for management and collaboration.
    
    ```bash
    # Run core tools locally
    docker compose up -d
    
    # Connect to KombiSphere for management
    # Get enterprise features without hosting complexity
    ```
    
    **Best for:**
    - Data sovereignty requirements
    - Hybrid cloud/on-prem setups
    - Gradual migration to SaaS
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
