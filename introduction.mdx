# What is kombify?

kombify is a **spec-driven infrastructure platform** that lets you define, simulate, and deploy your entire homelab in one YAML file. No more juggling docker-compose files, Terraform configs, and manual SSH sessions — just describe what you want, and kombify handles the rest.

## How it works

```yaml kombination.yaml
# This is all you write
stack:
  name: my-homelab
  domain: home.local

nodes:
  - hostname: proxmox-1
    type: proxmox
    role: hypervisor

services:
  - traefik      # Reverse proxy
  - authelia     # SSO
  - homepage     # Dashboard
  - immich       # Photos
```

**What kombify does:**
1. **Validates** your config with CUE schemas
2. **Simulates** the setup in Docker (optional)
3. **Generates** OpenTofu/Terraform code
4. **Deploys** to your infrastructure
5. **Manages** ongoing state and updates
