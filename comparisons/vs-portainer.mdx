# kombify vs Portainer

Both kombify and Portainer help manage containerized infrastructure, but they serve different purposes and excel in different scenarios.

<Note>
  **TL;DR:** Use kombify for full lifecycle infrastructure management with testing. Use Portainer for quick container visibility and management.
</Note>

## Quick Comparison

| **IaC Support** | Native (OpenTofu) | Limited |
| **Pre-deployment Testing** | Built-in simulation | No |
| **Templates** | StackKits (composable) | Stacks (Compose files) |
| **Multi-node** | All tiers | Business/Enterprise |
| **Pricing** | Free tier + paid | Free CE + Business |

## Detailed Analysis

### Philosophy & Approach

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="kombify" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    **Intent-driven & Spec-first**
    
    You describe *what* you want, and kombify figures out *how* to deploy it safely. Everything flows from a single `kombination.yaml` specification.
    
    - Test before deploy
    - Declarative configuration
    - Full audit trail
    - Drift detection
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portainer" icon="boxes-stacked">
    **UI-first & Immediate**
    
    You interact directly with containers through a visual interface. Changes are made in real-time through the GUI.
    
    - Immediate feedback
    - Visual management
    - Lower abstraction
    - Direct control
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Infrastructure as Code

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="kombify">
    kombify is built around Infrastructure as Code principles:
    
    ```yaml
    # kombination.yaml - Your entire homelab defined
    stackkit: base-homelab
    
    nodes:
      - name: server-01
        type: local
        connection:
          host: 192.168.1.100
    
    services:
      - traefik
      - authelia
      - immich
      - homepage
    
    config:
      domain: home.example.com
      email: admin@example.com
      authelia:
        default_policy: two_factor
    ```
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Version controlled (Git)
    - Reproducible deployments
    - Easy disaster recovery
    - Team collaboration via PRs
    - Automated rollbacks
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Portainer">
    Portainer uses Compose files as stacks:
    
    ```yaml
    # docker-compose.yml
    version: '3'
    services:
      traefik:
        image: traefik:v3.0
        ports:
          - "80:80"
        # ... manual configuration
    ```
    
    **Limitations:**
    - No dependency resolution
    - Manual service integration
    - No validation before deploy
    - State management is manual
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Pre-Deployment Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="kombify: Built-in Simulation">
    **kombify Sim** lets you test your entire configuration in virtual environments before touching real infrastructure:
    
    ```bash
    # Create a simulation from your config
    kombify sim create --from kombination.yaml
    
    # Run automated tests
    kombify sim test
    
    # SSH in to explore
    kombify sim ssh server-01
    
    # Satisfied? Deploy to production
    kombify deploy
    ```
    
    ✅ Catch configuration errors early  
    ✅ Test service interactions  
    ✅ Validate networking  
    ✅ Train without risk
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Portainer: No Built-in Simulation">
    Portainer deploys directly to your infrastructure:
    
    - ❌ No staging environment included
    - ❌ Test in production (risky)
    - ❌ Rollback requires manual backup
    
    You'd need to set up a separate test environment manually.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Templates & Reusability

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="kombify StackKits">
    StackKits are **composable, validated templates** that encode best practices:
    
    ```
    StackKits Available:
    ├── base-homelab      # Essential services
    ├── ha-homelab        # High-availability
    └── modern-homelab    # Kubernetes-native
    
    Each includes:
    - Pre-configured services
    - Security defaults
    - Networking rules
    - Add-on ecosystem
    ```
    
    **Customization is layered:**
    ```yaml
    stackkit: base-homelab  # Base template
    
    services:
      - +grafana           # Add optional service
      - -homepage          # Remove default service
    
    config:
      traefik:             # Override specific settings
        dashboard: true
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Portainer Stacks">
    Portainer uses plain Compose files as templates:
    
    - Upload any docker-compose.yml
    - No validation or best practices
    - Manual variable substitution
    - No dependency management
    
    **App Templates:** Portainer has a template system, but it's basic:
    - Single-service focused
    - No inter-service configuration
    - No validation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Multi-Node Management

| Capability | kombify | Portainer CE | Portainer Business |
|------------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Manage multiple nodes | ✅ All tiers | ❌ | ✅ |
| Centralized deployment | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Node health monitoring | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cross-node networking | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Agent-based | ✅ (gRPC/mTLS) | N/A | ✅ (HTTP) |

<Note>
  **kombify advantage:** Multi-node is free. Portainer requires Business tier ($110/node/year).
</Note>

### When to Choose Each

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Choose kombify when..." icon="check" color="#22c55e">
    - You're setting up new infrastructure
    - You want guided, opinionated defaults
    - Testing before deployment is important
    - You value Infrastructure as Code
    - You manage multiple nodes
    - You want to avoid "configuration drift"
    - Team collaboration is needed
  </Card>
  <Card title="Choose Portainer when..." icon="check" color="#3b82f6">
    - You have existing containers to manage
    - You need quick visual oversight
    - Simple single-node setup
    - You prefer GUI over YAML
    - Immediate changes needed
    - Learning Docker basics
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Can They Work Together?

Yes! Many users run both:

```yaml
# kombination.yaml
services:
  - portainer  # Include Portainer as a service
  - traefik
  - authelia
```

**Common pattern:**
1. Use **kombify** for infrastructure provisioning and major deployments
2. Use **Portainer** for day-to-day container monitoring and quick fixes
3. Sync changes back to `kombination.yaml` for consistency

<Warning>
  If you use both, be careful about drift. Changes made directly in Portainer should be reflected in your `kombination.yaml` to maintain consistency.
</Warning>

## Migration Path

### From Portainer to kombify

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export existing stacks">
    In Portainer, download your stack Compose files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import into kombify">
    ```bash
    kombify import docker-compose.yml
    ```
    This generates a base `kombination.yaml`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enhance with StackKit">
    Apply a StackKit for best practices:
    ```yaml
    stackkit: base-homelab
    # Your imported services are preserved
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with Sim">
    ```bash
    kombify sim create
    kombify sim test
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    ```bash
    kombify deploy
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Summary

| | kombify | Portainer |
|---|---------|-----------|
| **Best for** | Building infrastructure right | Managing existing containers |
| **Approach** | Spec-driven lifecycle | Real-time GUI management |
| **Testing** | Built-in simulation | None |
| **IaC** | First-class citizen | Optional/limited |
| **Complexity** | Medium (wizard helps) | Low |
| **Multi-node (free)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

<Tip>
  **Our recommendation:** Start with kombify to set up your infrastructure properly, then optionally add Portainer for visual monitoring if you prefer GUIs.
